# Automatic Watering System for Plants

Our **Automatic Watering System** is designed for plant owners who want to ensure their plants are properly hydrated even when they are away at work or on a trip. This system uses smart sensors to detect soil moisture levels and triggers automatic watering only when needed, preventing both overwatering and underwatering. It provides convenience and peace of mind for plant lovers who can’t always be around to care for their plants.

The system can be customized for indoor or outdoor plants and can be controlled remotely via a mobile app, allowing users to monitor and adjust watering schedules in real-time. It’s ideal for busy individuals, frequent travelers, or anyone who wants to maintain healthy plants effortlessly. With this solution, your plants will thrive, even in your absence.

## Features:

### 1. Soil Moisture Sensing
- Uses sensors to measure soil moisture levels and water the plants only when needed, avoiding over- or under-watering.

### 2. Watering Schedule
